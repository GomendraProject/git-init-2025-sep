Learnings
Over the course of the 6-day Git and GitHub workshop, I gained a solid understanding of version control and collaborative coding practices. I started by learning the basics of Gitâ€”how to initialize repositories, track changes, and manage file versions using commands like git init, git add, git commit, and git status. As the workshop progressed, I explored branching strategies, merging workflows, and how to resolve conflicts when multiple contributors work on the same codebase. I also learned how to use GitHub to host repositories, create pull requests, and review code collaboratively. Concepts like cloning, forking, and contributing to open-source projects were covered in depth. By the end of the workshop, I felt confident using Git and GitHub to manage projects efficiently, collaborate with others, and maintain a clean, organized development workflow.
