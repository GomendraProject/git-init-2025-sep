Learnings:

- How to use basic commands like git init, git status, git add, and git commit.
- How to configure username and email in Git.
- The process of branching and merging in a project.

Suggestions
A little more time on merge conflicts would help in understanding better.
Hands-on practice sessions with group collaboration could add more value.

I am very thankful to Kushal Niraula for guiding us patiently. The way the concepts were explained step by step made everything easier to understand. It was a very valuable and enjoyable experience. Thankyou !
